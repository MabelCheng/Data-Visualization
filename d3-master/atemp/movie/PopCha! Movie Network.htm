  <DT>Where does this come from?</DT>
  <DD>The <A href="https://www.popcha.tv/">PopCha!</A> mobile app      lets 
  users search for movies, view their details, rate them, add      them to bags 
  to build personalized movie lists and receive      notifications when they are 
  available in theaters, TV or Video      on Demand platforms. Its 
  recommendation engine allows proposing      users movies they might be 
  interested in. PopCha! users have so      far currently rated, added to bags 
  or otherwise showed interest      for more than 11,000 movies</DD>
  <DT>And how was this concrete "movie network" made?</DT>
  <DD>This is how we did it:         
  <OL style="margin: 0px;">
    <LI> We selected the movies with the top ratings (the most          highly 
    valued movies for PopCha! users). Those were our          initial seed, and 
    are the nodes with a red border in the          graph. As you can see, they 
    are mostly the "usual suspects",          but with also a few 
    non-conventional movies added in.</LI>
    <LI>Then we used our recommendation engine to find the          movies most 
    similar to them. Not by looking at their genre,          director or cast, 
    but by checking how users interact with          them. That is, two movies 
    are considered similar just by          checking if users rate them equally, 
    or usually appear          together in their bags. Those movies make up the 
    second          level in our network, marked with a grey border.</LI>
    <LI>Finally, we rounded up the graph by adding a third          level, 
    computed as the movies most similar to the ones in          the second 
    level</LI></OL></DD>
  <DT>Ok, but <EM>how</EM> was the graph actually computed?</DT>
  <DD>For those of you technically oriented, the links between      movies were 
  extracted as item-item similarity scores computed in      our Collaborative 
  Filtering engine, using all events produced by      users of the PopCha! 
  Android/iOS apps. Those links were then fed      to a <A href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Force-Layout">force-directed 
       graph layout</A> in <STRONG>D3.js</STRONG>.         <BR>No movie metadata 
  (title, director, cast, whatever) was used or harmed in any way during the 
  production of this graph.</DD>
  <DT>What do the graph elements mean?</DT>
  <DD>Each circle is a movie; it is linked to the set of movies      most 
  similar to it according to our engine (and therefore to      PopCha! users). 
  The size of the circle represents how it is      valued by PopCha! users; the 
  set of 25 most valued movies is      highlighted with a red border. <BR>When a 
  movie is selected (hovering or clicking) it is shown as purple in the network. 
  The set of movies linked to it (the ones more similar to it) are also 
  highlighted, this time in blue.<BR>The width of the link between two movies 
  reflect how similar they are (in terms of user response to them); this 
  similarity translates to the force attracting the nodes (so that two very 
  similar movies will tend to stay close, within the constraints imposed by the 
  rest of the forces from the other nodes).<BR>The force-directed layout is an 
  iterative algorithm; each time the page is loaded the rendering starts anew, 
  and converges towards a final stable state. There is some randomness in it, so 
  that no two final states are equal (but relative positioning of movies, and 
  the formed clusters, should be similar). 
  <DT>What is the resulting structure?</DT>
  <DD>The graph is heavily connected: there are connections between many of the 
  movies in the network (note that this is only a partial view of the overall 
  network: in the full graph there are many more connections, and also to the 
  movies that here appear to be at the edges).<BR>There is a strong central 
  cluster containing some of the most important movies (it is so dense that it 
  cannot be clearly seen unless you zoom in). Some of them are deeply connected, 
  check for instance <EM><A onclick="clearAndSelect(56);" href="javascript:void(0);">Seven</A></EM> 
  or <EM><A onclick="clearAndSelect(65);" href="javascript:void(0);">Forrest 
  Gump</A></EM>. Within that central cluster we can also identify thematic 
  subclusters, such as the <A onclick="clearAndSelect(52);" href="javascript:void(0);">Tolkien 
  saga</A>.<BR> Outside the graph core we can also find other areas with 
  semantic meaning (e.g. the set of <EM><A onclick="clearAndSelect(165);" href="javascript:void(0);">Star 
  Wars</A></EM> movies, or a group of classic <A onclick="clearAndSelect(61);" 
  href="javascript:void(0);">Hitchcock thrillers</A>). There is also a small <A 
  onclick="clearAndSelect(20);" href="javascript:void(0);">Western</A> cluster 
  (mostly Clint Eastwood movies) and a <A onclick="clearAndSelect(119);" href="javascript:void(0);">Tarantino</A> 
  group.<BR> As a curiosity, there seems to be an exaggerated importance given 
  to movies that are seemingly minor, but that share title with more significant 
  ones (i.e. there is a second <EM>Godfather</EM> or a second <EM>Gladiator</EM> 
  in the graph, try to spot them!). These might stem from user confusion when 
  selecting the movie they actually wanted.</DD></DL>
